# Angular Wrapkit Starter

This project is an adaptation from the popular UI Kit [WrapKit Lite](https://wrappixel.com/templates/wrapkit-lite/) (Free Bootstrap 4 UI Kit with lots of ready to use sections) to an Angular project. It is a starter kit to check and use this tool in an Angular enviroment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

A working Angular enviroment is required for this project. (I recommend the latest LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) and the latest version of the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/))

### Installing

**Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/Fransandi/angular-wrapkit-starter.git
```

**Install**
```
npm install
```
**Run a local server**
```
ng serve
```
